I checked the link in VirusTotal and it appears to be malicious : 

```
hXXps://www[.]google[.]com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fairblissco[.]com%2F.well-known%2Facme-challenge%2F007&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1Z3C1siL9ee8nYVkm6Y3xG#?8077507749Family=c3RlZWxjYXNlQHNlcnZpY2Utbm93LmNvbQ==
```

The URL prefix `hXXps://www.google[.]com/url?q=` is used by Google to track clicks on links within Google Search results and other Google services.
